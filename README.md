<p>The quotes are randomly chosen from a determined list of quotes in the database. The user can switch tabs by clicking <i>"All Quotes"</i> to see the full list of quotes in the database (sorted by author alphabetically). The user can also delete a particular quote from the list.</p>

## POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
- Add paginations to the list of quotes as it grows overtime.
- Offer different options in sorting the list of quotes.
- Change access to RESTful API so that users can't add quotes, and develop a web scraper to use existing resources to enter famous quotes into the database
